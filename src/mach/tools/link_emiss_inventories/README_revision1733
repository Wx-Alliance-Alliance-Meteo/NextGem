*** USER BE WARE ****
*********************
Starting with revision 1733, it is no longer necessary to provide
the gridded emissions (whether anthropogenic or biogenic) on the EXACT same grid that you are using for your 
simulation. As long as your domain of choice is contained within the domain of the gridded emissions, the emissions will be read.
For ACCURACY, it is essential that the grid points of your domain be coincident with the grid points of the gridded emissions;
AND that the grid spacing of your model grid be the same as the grid spacing of the gridded emissions.
If there is a mismatch, the emissions will be interpolated, and the interpolation method will be "Nearest"

*** CHANGE IN EXECUTABLE ***
****************************
Starting with revision 1733 the preparation of the emissions no longer requires an
executable. The preparation will be done by one of the tasks of the GM maestro suite.

*** CHANGE IN DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ****
**************************************
If you are using emissions, the Maestro suite requires that you specify their location. For major points
and area emissions, you need to specify the directories where they are found, and for the biogenic emissions
the full path and name of the file.

The Emissions Task of the maestro suite expects to find within the area and major point directories to following
structure:

   area_emissions_directory/month/area_shortmonth_day.fst 
   and
   mjrpt_emissions_directory/month/major_shortmonth_day.fst 
   
   where month takes the values {january february march april may june july august september october november december}
         shortmonth, the values {jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec}
   and   day, the values {sun mon tue wed thu fri sat}

The script "link_emissions_directories.ksh" provided in this directory can help you establish 
the appropriate structure. In its current form, it provides an example of how to link the current operational
emissions (found of the backend in the directory /fs/cmo/data/emissions_can2006_us2012_10km/) to the required structure
